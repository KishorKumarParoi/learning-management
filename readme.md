# Learning Management Web App

A **Learning Management System (LMS)** designed to provide an interactive and efficient learning experience. This application is built using modern web technologies such as **React**, **Next.js**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Framer Motion** for the frontend, with a robust backend powered by **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. It leverages **AWS services** like EC2, RDS, S3, and Cognito for scalability, security, and performance, along with a **CDN** for fast content delivery.
